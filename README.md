# Wordle Copilot

## How does it work?

1. You enter your guess on Wordle and then, you replicate the results you get from there on the copilot by entering your guess through the virtual keyboard and hit enter. Any words accepted by wordle are also valid here

2. Click on the tiles to mark perfect(green), present(yellow) and grey(absent).

3. Click on the suggestion you like and try it on Wordle. Hit enter and repeat steps 1-3. The keyboard will keep track of all the absent leters but not the present and perfect letters, so you'll have to make them for each guess.

## It's Not a Wordle Solver but a Copilot!
It only helps you solve wordle by narrowing down on the possible words using the data it has recieved but you need to pick the right suggestions based on your previous guesses.
